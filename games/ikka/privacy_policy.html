                    not collect
                    full payment card information — payments are handled by Google Play).</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics & Performance Data:</strong> Data collected by analytics providers to
                    understand how the

                <li><strong>Advertisements data:</strong> Data used to show personalized or non-personalized ads
                    (see

                <li><strong>Location (optional):</strong> If you grant permission, we may collect approximate or
                    precise
                    location data. We will request permission before collecting location.</li>
                <li><strong>Sensitive data:</strong> We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal data (e.g.,
                    health,
                    biometric, racial/ethnic) through the App. If such collection becomes necessary we will obtain
                    explicit
                    consent and update this policy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 style="font-size:20px;margin-top:20px;">3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information for purposes including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Operating and maintaining the App (gameplay, accounts, leaderboards).</li>
                <li>Processing purchases and providing customer support.</li>
                <li>Improving and personalizing the App experience (bug fixes, features).</li>
                <li>Analytics and performance monitoring.</li>
                <li>Displaying ads (personalized or non-personalized) if you opt in or if allowed by law.</li>
                <li>Complying with legal obligations and preventing fraud or abuse.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 style="font-size:20px;margin-top:20px;">4. Legal Basis for Processing (if applicable)</h2>
            <p>Where required by law (for example, the European Economic Area), we rely on one or more of these
                legal bases to
                process personal data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your consent (e.g., for personalized ads or analytics when required).</li>
                <li>Performance of a contract (e.g., to provide the game and features you requested).</li>
                <li>Legitimate interests (e.g., to improve the App, prevent fraud) — we balance these interests
                    against your
                    rights.</li>
                <li>Legal compliance, where necessary.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 style="font-size:20px;margin-top:20px;">5. Advertising & Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
                We may use third-party advertising networks and services (such as AdMob, Unity Ads, ironSource,
                etc.). These
                providers may collect
                device identifiers, advertising IDs, and other information to show ads and measure ad performance.
                They may also
                use cookies or similar
                technologies. If personalized ads are available, we will ask for consent where legally required.
            </p>

            <h2 style="font-size:20px;margin-top:20px;">6. Analytics</h2>
            <p>
                We use analytics services (e.g., Firebase Analytics, Google Analytics) to understand usage patterns
                and improve
                our App.
                These services collect information about your interactions with the App. Analytics providers are
                third parties
                and their data practices
                are governed by their privacy policies.
            </p>

            <h2 style="font-size:20px;margin-top:20px;">7. In-App Purchases & Payments</h2>
            <p>
                In-app purchases are processed by Google Play. We do not process or store your full payment card
                details. For
                billing questions contact
                Google Play support. We may receive confirmation of purchases and basic transaction metadata.
            </p>

            <h2 style="font-size:20px;margin-top:20px;">8. Data Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
            <p>We may share data with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Service providers who perform services on our behalf (analytics, hosting, customer support,
                    crash reporting,
                    ad networks).</li>
                <li>Law enforcement or regulatory authorities when required by law or to respond to legal processes.
                </li>
                <li>Business partners if we offer integrated features; we will always inform you and obtain consent
                    where
                    required.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 style="font-size:20px;margin-top:20px;">9. Transfers of Data</h2>
            <p>
                Your data may be processed in countries other than your country of residence. We will take
                reasonable steps to
                ensure an adequate level of protection
                (e.g., standard contractual clauses, relying on countries with adequate protections) when
                transferring personal
                data.
            </p>

            <h2 style="font-size:20px;margin-top:20px;">10. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
                We retain personal data only as long as necessary to provide the App and for legitimate business
                purposes (such
                as analytics, legal compliance, or dispute resolution).
                When no longer needed, we delete or anonymize your information.
            </p>

            <h2 style="font-size:20px;margin-top:20px;">11. Security</h2>
            <p>
                We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information.
                However, no
                method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
            </p>

            <h2 style="font-size:20px;margin-top:20px;">12. Children's Privacy</h2>

                personal
                information about your child, please contact us.
